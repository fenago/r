# Activity: Creating and Manipulating Factor Variables
## Scenario

You will not be able to avoid using factor variables in your work programming with R, so you set out to learn the best ways to create and manipulate them.

## Aim

To recognize, create, and manipulate factor variables.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have R and RStudio installed on your machine.

## Steps for Completion

1. Load the datasets library using library(datasets).

3. Load the diamonds dataset:
- Examine the dataset with str().
- How many factors are present, and what type are they?
- Verify with class() that they are of the class shown.
3. Load the midwest dataset if it is not already loaded in your environment:
- Examine the dataset with str().
- Turn all of the character variables into factor variables using the apply() method for changing many variables at once.
- Check your work with str().
