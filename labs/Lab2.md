# Activity: Installing the Tidyverse Packages
## Scenario

You have been assigned the task of developing a report using R. You need to install the Tidyverse packages to develop that report.

## Aim

To install Tidyverse, a set of useful packages that will be used later in the book. Load the inbuilt datasets into the project.  Use Google or ChatGPT if you must!

## Prerequisites

Make sure that you have R and RStudio installed on your machine.

## Steps for completion

1. Install the Tidyverse package using the install.package() function.
2. Load the ggplot2 library and the built-in msleep dataset.
Note that msleep is a built-in dataset in the ggplot2 package. We'll use R built-in datasets throughout this book.
4. Save the global image of the environment for use later use.

This activity was crucial. We've added a dataset and the Tidyverse packages to the project we intend to use for the rest of the book. We've also saved a copy of our global environment to our working directory. The Tidyverse packages, dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, and a few others, will be very helpful throughout this book and in your data science work.
