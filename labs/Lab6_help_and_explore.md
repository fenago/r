# Activity: Exploring the Introduction to dplyr Vignette
## Scenario

You have been asked to write code by utilizing the main verb functions (filter, arrange, select, mutate, and summarise) that are available in the dplyr package.

## Aim

To gain experience of looking for vignettes and to also introduce the dplyr package.

## Prerequisites

A web browser capable of looking at an R package vignette.

## Steps for Completion

1. Navigate, in your web browser, to the introduction to the dplyr vignette (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html). dplyr is a package that is part of the Tidyverse we installed way back in the first section. You can also access the vignette inside of RStudio by running vignette("dplyr") in a script or by typing it in the console. It will appear in the Help tab in the lower right window.
2. Open up a new R Script (File | New File | R Script). Save it as a file called dplyr_vignette_walkthrough.R.
3. Read the dplyr vignette, running at least the first line of code for each of the main five dplyr verbs (filter, arrange, select, mutate, and summarise). Make sure that your output mirrors that of the vignette.
4. Stop when you reach the heading Patterns of operations, about halfway down the page. (It is recommended that you return later and read the entire vignette, as the dplyr package is very useful.)

If you have time, play with the dplyr code a bit and try to understand more about how the main five verbs work through experimentation.
